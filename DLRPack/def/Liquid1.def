	"editor_var liquid_name"	"Searches for 'smoke_<liquid_name>' (defaults to water) in the entity colliding with the liquid.  Using this we can define custom splashs per object if we wish.  Example: set this value to water, define a smoke_water in an entity and wheneve the entity collides with this it spawns a smoke_water.  Also does a similar search for snd_<liquidName> to play a splash sound (default water/water_splash)"
	"editor_var smoke_small"	"If the colliding entity doesn't have a 'smoke_<liquid_name>' defined then we use this for small splashes."
	"editor_var smoke_medium"	"If the colliding entity doesn't have a 'smoke_<liquid_name>' defined then we use this for medium splashes."
	"editor_var smoke_large"	"If the colliding entity doesn't have a 'smoke_<liquid_name>' defined then we use this for large splashes."
	"editor_var smoke_waves"	"Similar to above, but only spawns a particle if the velocity of the colliding object is above minWaveVelocity."
